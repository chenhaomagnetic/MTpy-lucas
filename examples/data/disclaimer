DISCLAIMER

This folder contains examples for magnetotelluric time-series data. The data have been collected during an instrument test at the university of Adelaide, and they have 
been decimated afterwards. We cannot guarantee that they contain any scientifically relevant signals. They are solely intended to demonstrate the time series data file 
handling using MTpy. 
However, if you are interested in the details: The instrumentation for each station consisted of a pair of induction coils, three copper-sulfite electrodes, 
and an EarthDataLogger. The relevant parameters can be found in the ExampleSurveyConfigfile.cfg, which is located within this example directory. 

The raw data can be converted into re-oriented and scaled dayfiles (c.f. 'mtd_files' directory). For visual data analysis or the utilisation of standard seismological
processing software, the data have been converted into MiniSEED (c.f. 'miniseed' directory).

By using BIRRP (via the provided wrapping scripts), the time domain data have been transferred into frequency domain, and then converted into EDI files (c.f. 'edi_files' 
directory).

We hope that this example data set give an impression on how to easily handle data sets using MTpy.
